## About

This is the official Vue port of [React Bits](https://reactbits.dev)!

Vue Bits is a large collection of animated VueJS UI components made to spice up your web creations. We've got animations, components, backgrounds, and awesome stuff that you won't be able to find anywhere else - all free for you to use!

These components are all enhanced with customization options as props, to make it easy for you to get exactly what you need.

## Key Features

- 90+ total components (text animations, animations, components, backgrounds), growing every week
- All components have minimal dependencies, and are highly customizable through props
- Designed to integrate seamlessly with any modern Vue/Nuxt project

## CLI (<a href="https://jsrepo.dev"><img src="https://jsrepo.dev/badges/jsrepo.svg" width="50" alt="jsrepo"></a>)

Vue Bits uses [jsrepo](https://jsrepo.dev) for installing components via CLI. </br>
The setup steps can be found on each component's page in the [documentation](https://vue-bits.dev/).
